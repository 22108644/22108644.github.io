<h1>Unit 1</h1>

<p>How do websites work? How do emails reach your computer? How does the use of
computer applications affect your daily life? This unit provides an introduction to the
modern online world. Starting with your own experiences, you will extend your
knowledge of online services and investigate the technology and software that
supports them. You will learn more about a range of services including email,
online data storage, collaborative software, search engines and blogging.
This unit will help you understand the main technologies and processes behind the
internet and investigate how they come together to let you view websites and send
information across the world. The internet and web of tomorrow will be even more
powerful, more connected, more intuitive and a more important part of our lives.
This will result in an internet of services, objects and infrastructure (ubiquitous
computing) which will radically change our lives. For example, smart appliances will
be able to talk to each other, clothes will monitor our health and retailers will access
social media to gain insight into shoppersâ€™ preferences.
You will explore a range of digital devices, such as smart phones and digital music
players and consider the technology that enables these devices to share and
exchange information.
This technology has created new concerns regarding security and privacy. You will
investigate these concerns and consider how users should behave online to safeguard
themselves and respect others.
This unit is essential if you are considering a career in the IT sector. Online systems
and technology have become part of everyday work, so being able to understand and
work with this technology is relevant in many roles in the industry.</p>
