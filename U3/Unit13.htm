<h1>Unit 13</h1>

<p>Have you ever viewed a website and wondered how it was created? Many different
elements can be included in the website, such as text, graphics, animation, video and
programs. Many websites also contain sophisticated
interactive features such as database search facilities, online purchasing and
messaging. To be successful, a website must be visually interesting, while remaining
easy to use.
With the internet being central to how most organisations and individuals
communicate and do business, the creation and maintenance of websites is an
important job role. There is a strong demand in the job market for web developers
with appropriate technical and creative skills. For instance, a web-developer is a
technical role involved with designing and developing websites, a content manager
is responsible for keeping a website up to date and a search engine optimisation
specialist encourages user traffic from internet search engines to specific websites.
In this unit, you will investigate the features and uses of websites by exploring what
they are and how their integrated components and applications interact with each
other.</p>
