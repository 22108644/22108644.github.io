<h1>Unit 19</h1>

<p>Have you ever thought about why you are studying this qualification, what it could
lead on to and how social media and communication technology is changing the
delivery of projects in the workplace? This unit will help you answer these questions
and help to prepare you for your career.
In this unit you will understand the personal characteristics, such as communication
and self-management skills, which are valued by employers and you will demonstrate
some of these characteristics. You will prepare an application for one job in the IT
sector and creative computing industries demonstrating your technical and employability skills and using your
digital portfolio to showcase your achievements. This will also help you decide which
skills you should develop further and which career to pursue.
You will investigate what social media and communication technologies are and how
they impact on our working lives, as individuals, on organisations and society. This
will help you to prepare for your career and for future innovations in computing.
Organisations often split work into projects and it is important for projects to be
successful. In a similar way your course will be split into a number of projects,
focused either around particular units or on products and/or systems you develop.
Through delivering these projects you will demonstrate how social media and
communications technology can be used to improve the delivery of a project.
Improvements could include saving time, boosting the morale of staff and customers,
and/or increasing the quality of the outputs.</p>
