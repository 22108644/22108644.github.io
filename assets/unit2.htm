<h1>Unit 2</h1>

<p>Technology systems are involved in many of the objects we use every day, from
a laptop computer and routers relaying internet traffic, to logging in to a social
networking site. This unit provides a first look at how the main building blocks of
technology systems work.
You will explore the common hardware components of technology systems, such as
a touch screen or a printer, and the internal building blocks of a computer like the
processor, buses and memory. The unit also covers the purpose of networks, which
allow different devices within a technology system to communicate.
No technology system is complete without the software that brings it to life. You will
explore different types of software. These will include the operating system that
supports the communication and management of resources, and utility programs that
provide functionality to maintain the system.
You will also learn about the role of applications software, such as office programs,
graphics packages, accounting software and CAD/CAM, that supports many aspects
of everyday business life.</p>
